# Set Up a Turtle Graphics Race Using Object Oriented  

Reusing code at its finest (debatable). The process of creating a race between turtles (using TUrtle Graphics) can be organized a little more efficiently by approaching the design in an **Object-oriented** way. Since each turtle variable has similar attributes, we can use *generalization* by creating a class with these common attributes. This class tells Python how to make an object representing a turtle. After the creation of the class, you can use it to make individual instances of the class, each of whihc represents one specific turtle object.  

This approach to software design (object-oriented programming) allows you to be more efficient at writing code.
